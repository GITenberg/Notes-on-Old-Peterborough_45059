3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The Reminiscences of a Citizen whose memory goes back in
detail for over Seventy Years, as in the case of the Contributor
of these Notes, cannot fail to be of paramount interest and of
antiquarian value.&nbsp; Especially in this case, where the
distinguished Narrator has held a very foremost place in the
Professional life and Voluntary Public Service of the City.&nbsp;
Additionally interesting must they prove in the case of a City
which has developed from a comparatively small parish into a
populous industrial, commercial and residential Centre.&nbsp; The
Peterborough Arch&aelig;ological Society has in these
circumstances undertaken the duty of preserving and circulating
in compact form the very valuable personal Recollections of Mr.
Andrew Percival.&nbsp; In doing so the Society acknowledges its
indebtedness to that gentleman for his ready permission to
entrust them to its charge.&nbsp; The writer of this Preface was
present at the old Wentworth Rooms, at Peterborough, in the years
1883&ndash;4, when the addresses which formed the basis of this
chronicle were delivered.&nbsp; He thus felt a continuity of
interest when the manuscript was recently committed to him to
prepare, with illustrations, for advance publication in the
&ldquo;Peterborough Advertiser,&rdquo; in September, 1905, and in
bringing up to date, during the indisposition of the Author,
several of the chronological and statistical references.&nbsp;
Otherwise the Notes remain exactly as set down and corrected by
Mr. Percival.&nbsp; The Society expresses its thanks to Mr. A. C.
Taylor for the use of the very excellent photo of Mr. Percival
which forms the frontispiece; to Mr. T. N. Green (Ball &amp; Co.)
for the Photo of the Old Bridge; and to Mr. Geo. C. Caster for
the use of &ldquo;Whittlesey Mere&rdquo; block, from
&ldquo;Fenland Notes &amp; Queries&rdquo;; most of the others
having been specially taken and engraved for this
Publication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I came to Peterboro&rsquo; in
Oct., 1833, I think our population was five or six
thousand.&nbsp; In the month of August I came down to make
arrangements for my being articled to the late Mr. Gates.&nbsp; I
was taken charge of by my father, and protected by my sister, and
we drove from Northampton, where my father was a medical man
having an extensive practice, and could only spare one day.&nbsp;
During the night a most extraordinary storm sprang up.&nbsp; We
had to go back during that storm.&nbsp; There was an enormous
destruction of timber on the road between here and Northampton,
and in many other parts of the country.&nbsp; It was a storm such
as very seldom rages in these latitudes in the summer
months.&nbsp; In one part of the journey was a great avenue of
trees, a considerable portion of which was destroyed.&nbsp; It
was the property of a worthy squire, and I remember hearing it
remarked, &ldquo;How much Mr. So-and-So will feel the destruction
of his avenue.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear no,&rdquo; said the
person spoken to, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that that property
is settled property, and he has no power of cutting timber, and
he will be highly delighted.&nbsp; He thinks the avenue is <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>much improved,
as it puts a very good sum of money into his pocket, which is
very welcome to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; You see it is an ill wind that
blows nobody good.</p>

</a></p>
<p>When I got here, the first thing I saw when I looked round the
town was that it was confined by toll bars.&nbsp; There was a
toll bar just over the bridge, where the little house since
converted into shops then was.&nbsp; At the other end of the
town, on the Lincoln Road, was another toll bar; on the Thorney
Road was another, and at the back of Westgate another.&nbsp; Our
town had four gates drawn across the four entrances; on the road
now known as Lincoln Road East, then Crawthorne Lane, there was a
side bar to prevent anyone getting out of the town without paying
contributions.&nbsp; One enquired what these meant, because
within a mile or two on each of the main roads you would find
another toll bar, at which they duly took toll, and the only
villages that could get into Peterborough without paying toll
were Yaxley, Farcet, and Stanground, as the turnpike road toll on
that road, the old London Road, was near Norman Cross.&nbsp;
Otherwise, our system was so ingeniously contrived that you could
not get into or out of Peterborough without paying town toll at
the end of the street, which were tolls for the pavement.&nbsp;
This was rather a peculiar system.&nbsp; I do not wish to quote
Scripture, but you will recollect the enquiry, &ldquo;Of whom do
the Kings of the earth take tribute?&nbsp; Of their own children
or of strangers, and they said &lsquo;of strangers.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then the comment was &lsquo;Then are the children
free!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The system that our forefathers adopted for encouraging
communication and traffic was this: They put a toll on for their
pavements, from the payment of which they exempted themselves,
and took it from the strangers that came into the place.&nbsp;
The only exceptions were when the inhabitants of the place
travelled on Sundays.&nbsp; Toll collectors were then authorised
to take toll from them, and also from those who hired vehicles in
the place, the result being if you were an inhabitant of the
place, and had the luck to keep your carriage or gig or wagon, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>or whatever
it was, you might use the pavement as much as you pleased, and
pay nothing.&nbsp; But if you were a poor person, or could only
treat yourself occasionally with the luxury of a gig, or were
obliged to hire a trap for business, yon were immediately taken
toll of.</p>
<p>The present Hospital or Infirmary was then a private
dwelling-house.&nbsp; The Dispensary which existed then was a
small house opposite the Old Burial Ground, the one now occupied
by Mr. Payling, the dentist.&nbsp; After some years, it was
removed from this place to what is now the Police Station in
Newtown.&nbsp; Soon after this, the Earl Fitzwilliam purchased
the present building and presented it to the City, a monument of
his appreciation of the good that had been done in a small way by
the existing buildings, and which, I think, in the present
arrangements, fully carried out his Lordship&rsquo;s benevolent
wishes.</p>
<p>There were two considerable features of Peterborough which
have entirely disappeared.&nbsp; Where Queen Street and North
Street now stand were two large breweries, known as
Buckle&rsquo;s Brewery and Squires&rsquo;s Brewery.&nbsp; They
were quite institutions of the place, and it always strikes me as
a very strange thing that they should have entirely disappeared,
as one of them would have been larger than all the breweries now
in Peterborough.&nbsp; Buckles&rsquo; Brewery was certainly a
very remarkable one, and carried on with great energy and
spirit.&nbsp; There was one peculiarity they had&mdash;that some
friends of the partners could assemble on Easter Monday and spend
the afternoon in playing at marbles.&nbsp; I have spent pleasant
afternoons there on Easter Mondays.&nbsp; There were two large
tuns or barrels in which the beer was kept, one of which was
called Mrs. Clarke, and the other the Duke of York, to perpetuate
a scandal at the time when they were constructed.&nbsp; A very
hospitable time always followed the game at marbles.</p>
<p>Buckles&rsquo; Brewery was the cause of another peculiar
circumstance.&nbsp; On one occasion there visited the town for
the amusement of the people, a calculating boy.&nbsp; He went <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>through, his
entertainment with great success, and at last one of our worthy
inhabitants got up and asked the question &ldquo;How many gallons
does Mr. Buckles&rsquo; great copper hold?&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy
said he could not tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;No; I thought you could
not,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; Our worthy citizen had forgotten
to give the dimensions of the copper, and went away rejoicing
over the fact that he had puzzled the calculating boy!</p>
<p>He reminds me very much of a story one has heard in connection
with our own professional experience.&nbsp; A witness was called
to prove an assault, which consisted in a man having been knocked
down by a stone thrown at him.&nbsp; The counsel was anxious to
ascertain the size of the stone.&nbsp; The witness said &ldquo;do
you want to know how big it was?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said the counsel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The size do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it was
biggish.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I want you to tell me how big
it was&rdquo;!&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir, if you want me to tell you
how big it was, I should think it was as big as a lump o&rsquo;
chalk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, I think the gentleman who put the
question about the copper, and the witness, must have been very
nearly related.</p>
<p>When I arrived in the City, it became very important to me to
know how I could get away from it.&nbsp; I lived at
Northampton.&nbsp; Between Peterborough and Northampton there are
now eleven trains a day.&nbsp; When I came to Peterborough in
1833, and for some years afterwards, the only communication
between the town of Northampton and the City of Peterborough was
a one-horse carrier&rsquo;s cart, which came twice a week, and I
think the large proportion of its business consisted in carrying
parcels from the Probate Office at Northampton to the Probate
Office at Peterborough.&nbsp; For coaches we were pretty well
off.&nbsp; Two mails ran through Peterborough, the Boston Coach,
and the Coach to Hull.&nbsp; We used to go shares with the town
of Stamford with a London Coach.&nbsp; One of our townsmen ran a
coach to Stilton daily, where it joined the coach from
Stamford.&nbsp; At one time that coach carried the letter bag,
and on one occasion it started without the bag.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>There
was a man known as &ldquo;Old John Frisby,&rdquo; who was not
quite &ldquo;all there,&rdquo; and this man went after the coach
with the letter bag, and overtook it at Stilton.&nbsp; The poor
man was under the impression that he had done the State a great
service and thought he ought to receive a pension, and he daily
expected it until his death.</p>
<p>The Mail Coaches were very comfortable for travelling in fine
weather, and an eight or ten hours&rsquo; journey was very
pleasant, providing you did not ride inside.&nbsp; A journey to
London and Edinburgh occupied two whole days and nights.&nbsp;
The expense of such a mode of travelling was very great, being
five or six times as much as the ordinary first class railway
fare.&nbsp; Every fifty or sixty miles the Coachman would touch
his hat and say, &ldquo;I leave you here, sir,&rdquo; which meant
that you were to give him a fee.&nbsp; The guard would do the
same, and when your luggage was put up, the ostler came to
you.&nbsp; If you travelled post or in &ldquo;a yellow and
two,&rdquo; as it was called, you had to pay 1s. 6d. a mile,
beside the toll bars, and 3d. a mile for the post boy, as well as
something more that he always expected.&nbsp; The 3d. a mile for
the post boy, as his regular fee, is about equal to the highest
first class railway fare that is paid on any railway in the
country.</p>
<p>Just conceive what a change there is in the communication and
you do not wonder that the introduction of the railway system has
made a stationary nation into a nation of travellers.&nbsp; After
a time things did improve a little.&nbsp; The Birmingham Railway
was made at considerable cost.&nbsp; When I wanted to go to
Northampton, for many years I had to get up at six o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, hire a gig to go to Thrapston, where I caught the
Cambridge coach, which ran in connection with the coach at
Oxford.&nbsp; It cost about &pound;4 to go home and come back
again.&nbsp; When the Blisworth railway was opened, a coach was
set up from Lynn to Blisworth six days in the week.&nbsp; This
was a great convenience, and was very well supported.&nbsp; There
were two coachmen.&nbsp; One was very grave and serious and the
other light and frivolous.&nbsp; Everybody knew them <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>very well
indeed.&nbsp; It was very amusing to travel with them.</p>
<p>At last, the Northampton Railway was projected, and it was
plain to those men that their reign was coming to an end; but
they used to endeavour to convert you to the belief that it was
far better for things to remain as they were.&nbsp; The light and
frivolous one used to sing a song in praise of the &ldquo;Tally
Ho&rdquo; Coach.&nbsp; I remember the chorus was:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let the steam pot hiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until it is hot.<br />
Give me the speed of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tally-ho trot!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other coachman used to appeal to your fears, and say how
dreadful it was when a railway accident
occurred&mdash;&ldquo;when an accident occurred to the
coach&mdash;there you are!&nbsp; Just fancy an accident at 20 or
30 miles an hour; when that happens, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, we have survived it, and I am not sure that he was
accurate in his per centage of those injured in coach and railway
accidents.&nbsp; I have known some very fatal and distressing
accidents bearing a very large proportion of injuries and deaths
to those in the coach.&nbsp; I may mention that the Lynn coach of
Messrs. Hill was very good to take you to the sea, it was very
hard work to get to the beach in these days.&nbsp; I believe
Skegness consisted of a single house.&nbsp; The nearest place was
Yarmouth, and Messrs. Hill&rsquo;s car took you to Lynn, where
you could join the Birmingham and Yarmouth mail.&nbsp; I have
never forgotten my first visit to Yarmouth when a boy.&nbsp; From
the Norwich Road you caught the first view of the sea.&nbsp; As
you enter Yarmouth now by rail you go in over the marshes, and
the last two or three miles are by the side of muddy water, and
you cannot see the sea until you get on the beach.&nbsp; The
contrast between the way by the old coach and by the rail is very
striking, indeed.</p>
<p>In the year 1842 or 1843 it was rumoured that the London and
North-Western Company were about to feel their way eastward, and
the project for making the Peterborough and Northampton Railway
was put into shape.&nbsp; Our wildest dreams never expected a <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>railway.&nbsp; We had a coach, and that was quite a
novelty.&nbsp; The Bishop and Dean and Chapter had a good deal of
property on the line, and strongly opposed the railway.&nbsp;
When the Bill came into the House of Lords it was, to our great
delight, passed by a majority of One.&nbsp; There is an anecdote
of Lord Fitzwilliam, who was an opponent of the Bill.&nbsp; That
one day his Lordship was coming down by train, and in the same
carriage was one of those gentlemen who knew everything.&nbsp;
This gentleman was giving to a friend a history of the line, and
when passing Alwalton Lynch said: &ldquo;That is the road to
Milton Park, and do you know that Lord Fitzwilliam opposed the
Bill because they would not make him a station
there?&rdquo;&nbsp; A little further on the train stopped at
Overton Station, and his Lordship got out.&nbsp; Just as he was
shutting the door he said to the gentleman: &ldquo;That little
anecdote which you just told your friend about that crossing is
not true, and when you say anything more about it you may say
that Lord Fitzwilliam told you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Northampton line was opened in 1845, and I remember being
in the Cathedral when the first engine came down.&nbsp; It
stopped at the end of the Fair Meadow, for the Dean and Chapter
prevented the line being brought any nearer the town, as they
would not have Bridge Fair interfered with.&nbsp; The engine was
only about one-third the size of what they are now, but when it
blew off steam people said they would never be able to hear
anything in the Cathedral!&nbsp; Yet now no notice is taken of
what was looked upon then as a deafening noise.</p>
<p>We had next the London and York Railway, which then crossed
the Thorpe Road near where the old mill stood.&nbsp; Lord
Fitzwilliam compelled the Company to put the line by the side of
the Syston and Peterborough Railway, where it is now.&nbsp; There
were some amusing incidents connected with the Syston
Railway.&nbsp; It was strongly opposed by Lord Harborough, and
there were riots and fights between his men and the surveyors of
the line.&nbsp; I will say no more about the railway system.</p>
<p>The communications with Peterborough would be very incomplete
if one forgot the <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>river, because the river in those days was very
necessary to the comfort of the town.&nbsp; I daresay now, if I
were to quote Cowper&rsquo;s lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nen&rsquo;s barge-laden waves,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>people might say they did not think the load is very
heavy.&nbsp; But before the construction of the railway, and for
some year&rsquo;s afterwards, barges were found in very great
abundance.&nbsp; We derived our whole coal supply from the river,
and it was our great channel for carrying corn and timber.&nbsp;
The importance of the Nene to the counties through which it
passed was very great.&nbsp; Amongst other things was a Packet
called &ldquo;Simpson&rsquo;s Packet,&rdquo; and another
belonging to Messrs. James and Thomas Hill, which conveyed light
goods and passengers between Peterborough and Wisbech.&nbsp; I
recollect the old gentleman who commanded the packet held a very
high rank in the Navy indeed.&nbsp; He was a wooden-legged old
gentleman, very much respected, and known by the name of Admiral
Russell.&nbsp; He was commander of the Packet for many
years.&nbsp; I do not know who succeeded him, but someone who did
not attain so high a rank.</p>
<p>There was a joke against Mr. Whalley, M.P., that he promised
to make Peterborough a Seaport.&nbsp; If the projected scheme had
been fairly carried out according to the original intention of
the promoters, there would not have been a deal of money
wasted.&nbsp; Some think even now it should not be given up
altogether, if only for the purpose of preventing the railway
companies from putting too high prices on the carriage of goods
in cases where speed of transit is not essential.&nbsp; Goods
used to be brought from Wisbech in lighters, and it was a serious
thing in frosty weather, because all our coals were brought by
the river, and when the frost lasted long there was danger of a
coal famine.</p>
<p>Now I may mention about the postage.&nbsp; When I first knew
Peterborough the postage of a letter to London was 8d.&nbsp; A
little further on it would be 10d., and go on, until it came to
about 1s. 4d.&nbsp; When you were going to London in those days
you would <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>receive visits from your friends, who would ask you to
take letters for them and put them in the 2d. Post in London, and
sometimes it happened that these letters were found in your coat
pocket when you got home again!&nbsp; The postage of a
&frac12;oz. letter was 8d., but if you cut the sheet of paper in
two and used one-half as an envelope, the postage was 1s.
4d.&nbsp; If you divided the sheet of paper again and wrote a
cheque on one quarter of it, and the receipt to be signed and
returned on the other and put them into the other half sheet, the
postage was again doubled.&nbsp; When I was at school my eldest
brother, in a fit of benevolence, sent me 2s. 6d. in a letter,
and I was delighted until I was told the postage was 2s.
8d.&nbsp; The matron, however, found a way out of it.&nbsp; She
put the 2s. 8d. down to the governor&rsquo;s account, and I had
the half-crown.</p>
<p>These rates of postage were very heavy, but Members of
Parliament had the privilege of what was called
&ldquo;franking&rdquo; letters.&nbsp; They were continually being
applied to for these franks.&nbsp; They were only allowed,
however, to send a certain number of letters, and you always ran
the risk of having a bill sent in from the Post Office to the
person having the privilege of &ldquo;franking,&rdquo; and they
would send a footman to you, and you would then have to pay your
share.&nbsp; This privilege of franking was abused, and one would
hear that so and so had franked a ham, and one person was said to
have franked a piano!&nbsp; Whether this was the truth or not I
do not know, but it shows the advantage of getting rid of
exceptional privileges.</p>
<p>A few words about the government of our City.&nbsp; When I
first came to the Town, the principal governor, the one who made
the greatest impression on my youthful imagination, at all
events, was the Beadle.&nbsp; He was a very important
personage.&nbsp; His principal duty was to see the tramps out of
the town.&nbsp; He could not arrest them, but had to
&ldquo;fidget&rdquo; them out.&nbsp; He was always chosen with
special reference to his age and infirmity.&nbsp; He had a long
robe, a mace, and a cocked hat.&nbsp; He looked very imposing,
almost like Old Scarlett in the Cathedral put into a long coat, a
pair of knee breeches, and a cocked <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>hat.&nbsp; He was paid in this way:
At the Quarter Sessions he waited upon the Magistrates with a
bill: &ldquo;A man and a woman sent out Stamford Road,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Two tramps and a child, Lincoln Road,&rdquo; and so
on.&nbsp; As we say educationally, he was paid by results.&nbsp;
He was allowed so much according to his services.&nbsp; He was
the principal officer of the place, and was appointed by the
Feoffees.</p>
<p>About the year 1857 we were protected by Parish Constables,
and I think the principal duty of the constable was to report
himself at the Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; We had two gaols&mdash;we
could not do with one!&nbsp; One of these was that in the Minster
Precincts, recently vacated by the School of Art.&nbsp; The other
stood upon what is now the site of the Cumbergate
Almshouses.&nbsp; The one in the Minster Yard was maintained by
Lord Exeter as Lord Paramount.&nbsp; The other one, I think, was
paid for by the Magistrates.&nbsp; In 1840 we got an Act of
Parliament for a new gaol, and it was brought about in this way:
In about the year 1838 or 1839 a person walking through the
Minster Yard saw a head pop up out of the pavement, a body
followed, walked off, and was never heard of again.&nbsp; The man
had simply undermined the foundations of his cell with a knife or
bone and disappeared!&nbsp; He was the first that discovered that
way of escape!</p>
<p>About the same time in Peterborough was a family named
Rogers.&nbsp; They were the black sheep of the place.&nbsp; The
head of the family was known as Jimmy Rogers, and he took it into
his head to dine one day upon sheep&rsquo;s head and pluck which
he stole from a butcher&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; He was ordered to be
put into the Feoffees&rsquo; Gaol.&nbsp; He picked his way out,
and this thief of the district and his family disappeared and
never came back again.&nbsp; It was thought to be time we had a
gaol, and the present building on the Thorpe Road was
erected.</p>
<p>You must not think that we had no amusements.&nbsp; We used to
have a theatre on the site where the Corn Exchange now stands,
and a very good theatre it was.&nbsp; A very good company used to
come for about three months in the summer, and a very good
entertainment was afforded.&nbsp; The Bishop and <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>his Lady of
those days used to make a point of attending during the season,
and it was quite the thing to go to the theatre.</p>
<p>The Fairs were very important in those days.&nbsp; The
importance must not be judged by what is seen of them now.&nbsp;
Bridge Fair was then most important.&nbsp; It shows the antiquity
of the fairs that they had a special Court.&nbsp; All fairs and
markets of any antiquity had this Court which was to do justice
between man and man in any disputes arising at the fairs.</p>
<p>We had two Balls regularly, one for the National School and
one for the Infirmary.&nbsp; When political feeling ran high one
Party would go to the National School Ball and the other to the
Infirmary Ball.&nbsp; At other times each party would go to
both.</p>
<p>Peterborough was one of the last places in which Sedan chairs
flourished.&nbsp; They went on until some time after the railways
were established, which altered everything.&nbsp; The men were
too much occupied to be able to go with the Sedan chairs when
they were wanted, and so they gradually died out.</p>

<p>Whittlesey Mere existed in those days.&nbsp; It was thus
called because it had nothing whatever to do with
Whittlesey.&nbsp; It was several miles away.&nbsp; Whittlesey
Mere was one of the wonders of Huntingdonshire, Whittlesey being
in Cambridgeshire.&nbsp; Whittlesey Mere was a charming place for
skating in frosty weather and for fishing in the summer time,
when there was water enough, and for boating under the same
circumstances.&nbsp; Sometimes, when there had been a dry time it
became so shallow that you stirred up mud from the bottom when
you attempted to sail.&nbsp; It was very good for fishing.&nbsp;
One day we were out with a party, and we stopped at old Bellamy
Bradford&rsquo;s landing place.&nbsp; It shelved off so gradually
that the distinction between grass and water was so graduated
that a large pike, probably in pursuit of a fish, had gone so far
as to be prevented from getting back to his native element.&nbsp;
The place was surrounded by reed shoals, where reeds for
thatching grew, and these were the resort of innumerable
starlings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great point which strikes us
all, and which strikes everyone considering the history of the
last seventy years in the City of Peterborough is the very great
increase in the population, and when one began to think how it
came about we used to say &ldquo;it is owing to the
railways.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that is like telling you that the
world, as the Indians say, is supported on the back of a
tortoise!&nbsp; You want to know why the railways were wanted,
what the tortoise stands upon, because if you look into
statistics seventy years ago, before the railways, the population
of Peterborough was considerably increasing, and the populations
of agricultural districts altogether were very much increasing,
and when you go a little further, if you look at all into the
history of the land around Peterborough, or the country
altogether, you will find within a century there had been a great
change.&nbsp; Now, take for instance the immediate neighbourhood
of Peterborough.&nbsp; My recollection of it begins, as I have
said, at the latter end of 1833, at the commencement of the last
century.&nbsp; I think the only parish, if I except Fletton, the
only enclosed parish <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>within some few miles of this place
was the parish of Paston.</p>
<p>There you will rind the church, surrounded by old trees, and
the parish differed very much from others.&nbsp; If you look into
the Churchyard there you will find a great many names of the
inhabitants of Peterborough and other parishes outside
Paston.&nbsp; If you look into the Paston register you will find
marriages solemnised between inhabitants not belonging to Paston,
the undoubted fact being that the enclosed parish of Paston led
people to desire they should be married and buried there.&nbsp;
Paston was a kind of oasis in the desert.</p>
<p>Most of the parishes around here were in the position and
character of Castor, which until recently was the only open field
parish within many miles of this place.&nbsp; I was riding
through Castor field some years ago, before it was enclosed, with
a few farmers, when one turned round and said: &ldquo;How should
you like to farm this parish?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at
all,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; A man in the parish who had a
farm of a hundred acres would have to go to his farm in four
different parts of the parish&mdash;some against Ailsworth,
Milton Park, Alwalton, and so on, perhaps scattered in pieces of
one acre, two roods, and so forth.&nbsp; So that with a large
farm a man would have to go to a farm of a hundred acres to as
many different places two or three miles apart.&nbsp; The pieces
were so narrow that they were like ribbons; you could plough
lengthways but not crossways.&nbsp; As soon as you turned, you
got on to your neighbour&rsquo;s land, which was frequently a
subject of dispute.&nbsp; Conceive the state of the cultivation
of the country generally when that was the system not only in one
parish, but in the general bulk, at all events, in this part of
the kingdom.</p>
<p>Peterborough was open.&nbsp; All the parishes, to my
knowledge, from Peterborough to Deeping, and east to west, have
been enclosed since 1812.&nbsp; There was a beacon lighted at
night to light the passengers over the weary waste, since brought
into cultivation.&nbsp; Just conceive, if you can, the state in
which this part of the country was then, and in what it is now,
and consider the great increase of corn that can be grown, and
not <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>only
corn that can be grown, but the stock that can be fed by the
cultivation of roots and the introduction of bone manure, and
then you get some idea of the increased production of the
country, that rendered improved roads, terminating in railroads,
necessary.&nbsp; For the same reason, the marvellous increase in
the manufacturing districts has been kept pace with in the
agricultural production of the country, another feature in our
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>If you begin at Cambridge and draw a line along the high land
by St. Ives, east of Peterborough, by Spalding and Boston, down
to the Humber, you will find the tract of land known as the Fen
Country.&nbsp; That country has undergone within the last seventy
or eighty years, or a great part of it, a change even more
striking than that which has passed over the uplands.&nbsp; At
first you would be inclined to doubt whether there were any such
places as the Fens at all.&nbsp; If you say to anybody
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you live in the Fens&rdquo;? the reply will be
&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Peterborough we are not in the
Fens.&nbsp; Of course not!&nbsp; There is Flag Fen, and there is
Borough Fen, but we are on high ground, and not in the Fen, and
you will find, even if you go east of Wisbech, where the land is
called marsh land, which sounds rather funny, that the farmers
and graziers there will say they don&rsquo;t live in the
Fens.&nbsp; And walking towards the sea you will always be told
you have come to the wrong place, you must go a little further,
and then you will find the Fen country!&nbsp; But still, take the
Fens as we know them, extending from Peterborough to Cambridge,
and down by Boston nearly to the Humber.</p>
<p>I will confine my observations to that which most comes within
my own knowledge, that district of the Fens known as the Bedford
Level, called the South, the Middle, and the North Level.&nbsp;
From the beginning of Crowland on the North, down to, say, the
Middle by March and Lynn, and the South down to Cambridge.&nbsp;
In the year 1637 a Charter was passed by Charles I. for the
improvement of that country, and we form some notion of what it
must have been&mdash;the weary waste of waters it must have
been&mdash;<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>from the preamble of the Charter of Incorporation.&nbsp;
It is described as being generally covered with water, of little
advantage to mankind, except yielding some few river fish and
water fowl, that is when you may catch them, and on lucky days
you may shoot wild ducks.&nbsp; Adventurers had endeavoured to
make lines of meadows, which had made such progress that it was
hoped this place, which had lately presented nothing to the eye
but waters and a few reeds thinly scattered here and there,
might, under Divine mercy, become some of it pleasant pasture for
cattle, with many houses belonging to the inhabitants.&nbsp; That
seemed to have been the extreme notion of what could be made of
that country in the way of production.&nbsp; Going on to the year
1830, when the last history of the Bedford Level was written by
Mr. Samuel Wells, well known as the Register of the Corporation,
he speaks of it seventy-five years ago as a matter of
congratulation that at that time, when they had improved it
sufficiently to grow oats and cole seed, that the cultivation of
wheat had begun to extend itself into the Fen country.&nbsp; He
spoke of it almost as a novelty, and says that the Corporation,
soon after its formation, had interfered to prevent the
inhabitants, occupiers, and owners of property from improving and
draining by mills.&nbsp; He says that the system of drainage by
mills was abandoned in consequence of the result of the suit to
prevent it being favourable to the Corporation.</p>
<p>However, in a short time, after many struggles, the Level
becoming so inundated by the choking of interior drains, the
defective state of the rivers, and neglected improvement of
outfalls, the Corporation found it impossible to resist the
importunity of the country to resort to artificial drainage, and
therefore waived their objection, and allowed a return of the
mill system.&nbsp; The mill system up to 1830 consisted simply of
working a machine by wind to lift the water out of some embanked
portion of the Fens into a drain at a higher level, to conduct it
to one of the main drains of the Corporation to the outfall in
the sea.&nbsp; Seventy years ago, Mr. Wells tells us, in <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the whole
district of the Bedford Level&mdash;350,000 acres&mdash;there
were only five steam engines, one being in the parish of
Newboro&rsquo;, put up on the enclosuse.&nbsp; He says there was
a general opinion that steam drainage would be further
prosecuted, but this depended upon the finances of the district,
and he goes on to say many intelligent Fenmen indulged the hope
of acquiring a natural drainage, when the result of the work now
undertaken, in a greater or a less degree on all three levels,
can be fully understood and ascertained.&nbsp; The author,
however, says he cannot rank himself amongst the number of those
sanguine persons.&nbsp; He thought it great progress to get five
steam engines, and hoping they would get more, he, as an
intelligent Fenman, thought it was as much as he could
anticipate.</p>
<p>I think in the year 1827 or 1828 one of those works, the Nene
outfall, had been undertaken, the object of which was to make the
channel to the sea through the high and shifting sands, which
were at the entrance of the Wash, through which the waters of the
Nene found their way to the sea.&nbsp; It was carried out.&nbsp;
I think Mr. Tycho Wing was the great inaugurator and Sir Jno.
Rennie the engineer.&nbsp; It was so thoroughly successful that
it at once allowed the interior drainage of the country to be
vastly improved, and not only so, but up to the present time, by
the operation of the Nene Outfall Act, no less than 5,800 acres
of land have been actually reclaimed from the sea, the value of
which is at least from &pound;40 to &pound;50 per acre.&nbsp; Not
only was the Fen district materially improved, but a tract of
country equal to a large parish was obtained, the value of which
alone would, in a measure, repay all the expense of the
undertaking.&nbsp; Then they went on, following the success of
that, to get the North Level Act in 1830.&nbsp; The effect of
that was that water mills and steam mills disappeared, and they
now have natural drainage by the water finding its way by
gravitation to the sea.</p>
<p>In 1840 a similar work was begun in the Middle Level, and they
now have natural drainage in nearly the whole of that
Level.&nbsp; The only exception is about Whittlesey <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Mere, where
they have a steam pump and a steam water-wheel to carry away the
floods.&nbsp; What was the effect of that?&nbsp; In the first
place a tax was put on.&nbsp; In the Middle Level and North Level
the yearly tax may be taken at about 8s. 6d. or 9s. per acre
altogether.&nbsp; It sounds a very large sum where the land
itself, in many instances, was worth next to nothing before, but
the effect has been that in that district, I am not exaggerating
when I say, leaving the tax out of the question, that is, after
putting the tax on the land and comparing it to what it was
before, the land is worth double, and, in many instances, treble,
and where land without the tax was worth &pound;10 an acre, it is
now worth &pound;20 or &pound;30.&nbsp; I have had through my
hands deeds of an estate in the Fen.&nbsp; It contained 200
acres.&nbsp; In 1824 it was sold for &pound;1,155; in 1829 for
&pound;1,880.&nbsp; In 1882, notwithstanding the time of
depression, it was sold for &pound;5,000, without any special
bargain.&nbsp; Just think of the increase in the value of the
country in consequence of what has been done, and I think you
will see at once why the district has required railway
accommodation.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells speaks of the &ldquo;Intelligent
Fenmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe in their intelligence!&nbsp; In
their Parliamentary battles they are as warlike as people can be
in protecting the valuable interests of which they are the
custodians, and counsel in Parliamentary committees have often
said: &ldquo;How well those men understand their business; how
ready they are, and what talent they show in stating and
maintaining their cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is rather a
digression, but it accounts very much, I think, for the great
changes in this part of the country to which we belong.</p>
<p>Now let me endeavour to show the changes in Peterborough
proper.&nbsp; I will supply an omission, with an apology to my
old friend, the old Town Bridge.&nbsp; I am ashamed to find that
in my previous notes I had omitted to say anything about
it.&nbsp; That was rather extraordinary, because I had my mind on
it, and when I first came from Northampton my first acquaintance
with Peterborough must have been &ldquo;over that
bridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is an old proverb which says
&ldquo;Find no fault <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>with the bridge which carries you
over.&rdquo;&nbsp; With every disposition to be charitable, that
is the only good thing I can say of the old Bridge.&nbsp; It
carried me over, and there was no instance that it ever fell in,
but there was always a fear that it would fall, and everybody
thought it ought to fall, but it did not, and I mention this
because I think our new Bridge is a striking instance of the
public spirit of the inhabitants of Peterborough and the
neighbourhood in subscribing the cost of one-half of it, and also
of the fairness and liberality which the county authorities
displayed in meeting the inhabitants in assisting to get a new
bridge&mdash;a credit to the district&mdash;rather than patch up
that shabby, ramshackle concern, which, patched from time to
time, might have outlived another hundred years, and a suspicion
that it would fall, but never actually falling.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We will walk up Bridge Street and take a turn round the
outskirts of the town as I knew it years ago.&nbsp; Going past
the toll-bar in Cowgate we come to the building known as Sexton
Barns; probably some of you recollect it, a fine old building; it
was an object that vanished when the railways were made, because
now it is the site of the G.N. Station.&nbsp; There was a
handsome tree near the Crescent, where Peterborough began to
stray into the country; the Crescent had been erected four or
five years before.&nbsp; Opposite was the house where Mrs. Cattel
lived, and then the house where Dr. Skrimshire lived (now Dr.
Keeton&rsquo;s).&nbsp; Walking a little further, we came to the
Town Mill; very much like the Town Bridge, it had seen better
days and, like the Bridge, it had had a history.&nbsp; It had
been the property of the Dean and Chapter, and, without the
smallest doubt, it came down to them from the Abbot and Convent,
who were the Lords of this district.&nbsp; These town mills were
mills which the largest landowners kept for the accommodation of
their tenants, who were thereby provided with the means of
grinding their corn at a small cost, but were compelled to use
them and pay grist to the millers, and the old law books contain
much on the subject.&nbsp; Its need passed away, the <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>mill got into
private hands; it seems to have become worse and worse, and at
last it was burnt down, and we know it no more, the very site
having been utilised in an exchange of property for the erection
of the present King&rsquo;s School in Park Road.</p>
<p>On the opposite side is the Union Workhouse, built about 1834
or 1835.&nbsp; It has been very much beautified, but it is not a
handsome building now.&nbsp; It has had a new front or
facing.&nbsp; I may mention in passing that I recollect at one
time there was a persistent cry made by some portion of the Press
against the new Poor Law, against the hardship of separating man
and wife, and so on, but never was so persistent an attempt made
in that part of a portion of the Press with such signal failure
at the time, although since come to pass where desirable.&nbsp;
The new Poor Law took the place of one that was probably ruining
the country, and is, in these later days, itself under
review.</p>
<p>We then walk along the road back towards Peterborough, and we
find the Gaol and Sessions House.&nbsp; This Gaol was built in
1840.&nbsp; There was a fight between the Dean and Chapter, and
their Lessee, and the Magistrates about the enormous price asked
for it, and a jury was appointed, but a price of two or three
times more than was paid at that time for the land has been paid
since for land.&nbsp; If anyone had it to sell now at the same
price he would be very happy.</p>
<p>Between the Gaol and the Workhouse there is a nice
quiet-looking residence (Mr. Noble&rsquo;s).&nbsp; It was, till
recently, devoted to the supply of milk, but it was built as a
public house, put up by a brewery in order to supply
accommodation for people who resorted to the Sessions House at
the weekly meetings of the Magistrates, and at the Quarter
Sessions.&nbsp; There was a temperance wit of the day who said,
&ldquo;No, it is put there to show the close and intimate
connection between the gin shop, the gaol, and the
workhouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; We will go back to the town, the whole of
that known as Newtown, long before the railways, between 1815 and
1833, had been erected, so that it was, strictly and literally,
&ldquo;Newtown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>We then
pass Squire&rsquo;s Brewery at the entrance to Lincoln Road,
where the Liberal Club and Masonic Hall now stand, and we go to
Boroughbury; all beyond the malting formed part of Squire&rsquo;s
Brewery, going past what is known as the &ldquo;Square
Pond.&rdquo;&nbsp; The houses there, including a large part of
the Catholic Church and other buildings, are actually built upon
that which was, in 1833 (and many years afterwards), covered with
water.&nbsp; I was intimate with Mr. Buckle, who succeeded Mr.
Squire in that brewery, and I was permitted to fish in the pond
as often as I pleased.&nbsp; I have stood upon that spot which is
now a public road and have caught pike and eels, and used to have
very capital sport there.&nbsp; In the winter time it was a
favourite resort, not thrown open to the public altogether, but
still, with great liberality, it was allowed to be used for
skating.&nbsp; I was very unlucky one day.&nbsp; It was just
after a gentleman had bought the house, afterwards Mrs.
Willoughby&rsquo;s (now shops erected by Mr. W. D. Nichols), and
the grounds about it, was walking in his grounds, when he saw me
pull out a large pike, and he was so enchanted with it, he
thought it would be a great benefit to his property, and to my
disgust, but the pleasure of Mr. Buckle, he bought the pond and
merged it into his private grounds.&nbsp; I never caught any pike
there again!</p>
<p>Passing the outskirts of the town, we pass the great Tithe
Barn, Boroughbury, an interesting and attractive specimen of
antiquity and a good specimen of that kind of barn.&nbsp; You go
up that junction of Lincoln Road to Dogsthorpe, and there past
the last house until you come to two or three cottages, then
belonging to a retired tailor, named Mitchell, and people had
been profane enough to christen those cottages &ldquo;Cabbage
Row.&rdquo;&nbsp; What connection there is between a tailor and
cabbage, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Crossing the fields now laid out by the great roads of the
Land Company, and which at that time were the most secluded
fields around Peterborough, and going down Crawthorne Lane you
came to a junction&mdash;a <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>little lane at the back of
Boroughbury, now a wide street behind St. Mark&rsquo;s Villas,
which runs up to Park Road, and there four roads met, where there
was a little tombstone which was known as the &ldquo;Girls&rsquo;
Grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; A girl was buried there, with a stake through
her body, without Christian burial.&nbsp; The place was very well
known, and for long remained in the midst of a potato garden
belonging to one of the cottages there.</p>
<p>You go as the crow flies to a place called Frog Hall, in front
of St. Mary&rsquo;s Vicarage, one of the cottages remained till
1904, and the place had a very unsavoury reputation.&nbsp; It was
inhabited by squatters, gipsies, and travellers, and was one of
the least desirable parts in that neighbourhood.&nbsp; Then came
a row of cottages known as Burton&rsquo;s Row, where Peterborough
attempted to travel past its boundaries and get into the
country.</p>
<p>Going back, we come to the Cemetery, but at that time all were
grass fields let out as accommodation ground, and quite
secluded.&nbsp; A little further on were the Gas Works.&nbsp; Now
they <span class="GutSmall">ARE</span> Gas Works.&nbsp; When I
came they were, as compared with the present, in about the same
proportion as a small kettle to a large steam engine
boiler.&nbsp; A gentleman named Malam&mdash;a Hull man&mdash;used
to supply all the little towns in the country, and used to
contract with the inhabitants to supply gas for them.&nbsp; There
was no Act of Parliament, or anything of that sort, but
permission from the Local Authorities to break up the streets and
roads was all that was required, and he chanced it.&nbsp; I think
Mr. Sawyer used to give as much time as he could spare from his
own business, until he became, as the town increased, by
purchase, the owner of the works, and he then gave his whole time
and attention to them, and a very nice property it developed into
by the time the present company took it off Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>That is the history of gas in Peterborough.&nbsp; This brings
us back to the Long Causeway and the Market Place.&nbsp; Not the
market now, as I recollect it!&nbsp; Up to the year 1848 the
farmers attending the market used to <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>cool their heels in the open air in
front of the Town Hall, hot or cold, wet or dry, rain or snow,
blowing or still, there they stood, till the Theatre, now the
Corn Exchange (since largely added to), became vacant, and it
occurred to some agricultural gentleman that they could be much
more comfortable in every way if they could form a company, and
they did so, and I think no one will doubt that is an
improvement.&nbsp; On the Long Causeway, the Cattle Market was
the principal institution of the place, and I will tell you
why.&nbsp; On Saturdays that place was wholly given up to
them.&nbsp; There they were; nobody paid anything; anybody who
had cows or horses to sell brought them there.&nbsp; They became
the proprietors of the street for that day.</p>
<p>Our widest and best street was spoilt; because if there is one
thing more certain than another it is that the female mind most
intensely abhors anything approaching contact with horned
animals.&nbsp; Somehow or other, it seems to disturb that
equanimity which appears to be utterly indispensable to a lady
when she is going what she calls &ldquo;shopping,&rdquo; and it
would take away all her ideas to think she was going to meet a
restless-looking cow or a doubtful looking ox.&nbsp; It takes
away all notion of colour, shape, and measure, or whether the
thing will wash or not.&nbsp; The consequence was, the Long
Causeway was practically abandoned on market days, and it was not
much more used on other days for shopping purposes, because in
anything like changeable or damp weather the atmosphere of the
street was what I have heard ladies describe (not meaning to be
complimentary) as &ldquo;smelly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore,
naturally, there was great rejoicing among the inhabitants
generally when that street was restored to a cleanly wholesome
state by the construction of the Cattle Market.</p>
<p>The Wednesday Cattle Market had a very peculiar growth.&nbsp;
It was set up without the smallest authority about 1845 or 1846
by an old gentleman named Dean, who was a retired farmer, and an
enterprising auctioneer named Dowse, who kept the
&ldquo;Greyhound.&rdquo;&nbsp; They suggested that fat stock
should be brought, and it came more and <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>more, until
it grew into that excellent stock market, which became one of the
best in the Kingdom.&nbsp; There was no foundation for it but
that of custom.&nbsp; When the new market was proposed, the
farmers invited the then authorities, the Improvement
Commissioners, to construct it for them, but they made their bow
and said, &ldquo;If you want a market, make it for
yourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was made by a limited company, and it
has since fallen into the hands of the authorities, and Broadway
constructed through it.</p>
<p>We have another market which has grown up, and that is the
present Wednesday Market on the Market Place, which I think is
one of the greatest curiosities that ever comes under one&rsquo;s
notice.&nbsp; It does no harm to anyone.&nbsp; I went there
recently, and I saw an extraordinary medley of things exposed for
sale.&nbsp; I wondered at first if they were to be given
away!&nbsp; I could understand anybody wishing to sell them, but
wondered who could wish to buy them.&nbsp; It is one of the
things no one can understand.&nbsp; But it affords the means of
getting rid of most undesirable things, call them furniture, or
anything else!&nbsp; It puts me in mind of a shop in the Market
Place at Great Yarmouth, where they say you may buy
anything.&nbsp; A visitor, a clergyman, was told he could get
anything he wanted.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I want a
pulpit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; his friend said,
&ldquo;go in and try.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went in and said, &ldquo;Do
you happen to have a pulpit?&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;Well,
we do happen to have a pulpit.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I think I have
seen everything in our Wednesday&rsquo;s Market except
that.&nbsp; I have not seen anything so useful as a pulpit!</p>
<p>I have spoken of our accommodation for the living.&nbsp; What
do we do for the dead?&nbsp; We have the Cemetery, which has been
considerably enlarged since it was first formed in 1852 or 1853,
and the rapid increase of the Cemetery suggests the difficulty of
the disposal of the dead in a creditable and satisfactory manner
with our increasing population.&nbsp; The old burial ground was
opened in the year 1802, and it is one of the peculiarities of
this peculiar place, and of the old jurisdictions here, that the
old Parish Church appears to have had in ancient <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>times no
burial ground belonging to it, a thing that very seldom happens,
for the burial ground of the Parish of St. John the Baptist was
outside the Minster, which is an extra parochial district.&nbsp;
This remained up to 1802, when the burial ground in Cowgate was
formed.&nbsp; If you go into it sometime (I am very fond of
looking at the tombstones), you will find the oddest
peculiarities of language and literature as inscriptions on the
tombstones, but I cannot say I have ever found much to
admire.&nbsp; You will find a collection of legends which are
common all over the country, commencing with</p>
<blockquote><p>Affliction sore, long time he bore,<br />
Physicians WAS in vain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pale consumption gave the silent <span
class="GutSmall">BELOW</span>, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our graveyard in Cowgate there is an epitaph upon old Mrs.
Thomas, by which you are informed, that</p>
<blockquote><p>Making carpets and beds she did pursue<br />
With care and industry is very true,<br />
The established religion she did profess<br />
In hopes, through Christ, of Heaven to possess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such rubbish as that, under the veto of the present Cemetery
Commissioners, will, I hope, soon disappear.&nbsp; But there is
one in the Cathedral graveyard (the existence of which is not
generally known), on the tombstone memorial of an old family of
this place, and I trust it will not be allowed to
disappear.&nbsp; It is very superior to what they generally
are.&nbsp; It is on the right just as you go through the Arch by
the Deanery, and is to the memory of one of the Richardson
family:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stranger pass by nor idly waste your time<br />
In bad biography or bitter rhyme;<br />
For what I am, this cumbrous clay ensures,<br />
And what I was, is no affair of yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old gentleman, as you see, has carried his cynical humour
to the grave with him.&nbsp; It was quoted in an article in
&ldquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; on &ldquo;Monumental
Inscriptions&rdquo; a few years since.</p>

Came</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Retrospective</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my former Notes I alluded to the
Post Office.&nbsp; Well, the first Post Office I recollect was a
little room about 10ft. square&mdash;I think it has been altered
since&mdash;in one of those houses at the back of the
&ldquo;White Lion&rdquo; gates.&nbsp; An old gentleman lived
there who was Postmaster, and I think he was assisted, being
rather infirm, by his daughter, and I have been told it was the
amusement of a little grandchild or a little boy accustomed to
visit him, that by way of a treat he was allowed to catch letters
in his pinafore, and as a grand treat he was allowed to stamp
them.&nbsp; At that time the Post Office establishment consisted
of the Postmaster, the lady who assisted him, and the letter
carrier, who, as some of you recollect, was Mrs. Waterfield, a
tidy woman, who had a little basket in which she carried
letters.&nbsp; By degrees the establishment got on.&nbsp; You
will bear in mind that at that time we were not troubled with
Post Office Orders.&nbsp; There was no way of conveying 5s. or
6s. in stamps, or by order, from one part of the country to
another.&nbsp; The present Post Office consists of palatial
buildings, since their enlargement in 1904, and great
departmental accommodation, the smallest room of which is larger
than that old Post Office altogether.&nbsp; It would not do now
to catch letters in a pinafore, as their number is many millions
a month.&nbsp; There are telegraph messages, Post Office Orders,
and Savings Bank business.&nbsp; The Postmaster and old woman
have grown into a Postmaster at &pound;500 a year, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Chief Clerk,
a very important personage, the Assistant Superintendent (Postal
Department), the Assistant Superintendent (Telegraph Department),
7 controllers, and a staff numbering altogether nearly 350, with
66 sub-Post Offices&mdash;a pretty good number.&nbsp; A great
deal of the business is forwarding mails passing through
Peterborough, as a convenient centre for such purposes.</p>
<p>Then, as to newspapers, we used to have once a week the
&ldquo;Stamford Mercury,&rdquo; a very good paper, full of
advertisements and local news, but the &ldquo;Stamford
Mercury&rdquo; was always conducted on this principle:
&ldquo;Opinion is quite free in this country, and we are going to
dictate to nobody,&rdquo; so you never have editorial articles in
the &ldquo;Stamford Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp; They used sometimes to
select leaders and bits of intelligence from other papers,
generally of one way of thinking.&nbsp; Then we used to have the
London papers.&nbsp; They cost 7d. each.&nbsp; London papers used
to come down the day after publication, after they had gone the
round of the club houses, the hotels, and the London eating
houses.&nbsp; Those that had been in the eating houses used
sometimes to come in rather a greasy form.&nbsp; Now we can have
the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; on our breakfast table, or earlier if
wished.&nbsp; After a time some gentlemen thought we were very
benighted in Peterborough, and two of them, very much in advance
of their age, started what we should now call a Society paper of
a very pronounced type called the &ldquo;Peterborough
Argus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first one heard of it was, after one or
two publications, that a solicitor had inflicted upon the
responsible Editor a sound thrashing for a libel.&nbsp; The case
went to the Northampton Assizes, and although the verdict was not
quite &ldquo;served him right,&rdquo; the publisher got damages
of very small amount.&nbsp; It was one of the most scurrilous
papers in its way, and at length it became intolerable.</p>
<p>We now have in Peterborough four newspapers, besides a most
ample supply of daily newspapers.&nbsp; It has been very
interesting to witness the growth of Peterborough newspapers,
particularly that of the <span class="smcap">Advertiser</span>
(the first in the field&mdash;in 1854) from its small two pages
to the very satisfactory form in <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>which it now appears, with its
mid-weekly auxiliary, the <span
class="smcap">Citizen</span>.&nbsp; There was also a difficulty
as to supply of books.&nbsp; There was a book club, the Church
Porch Club, existing fifty years ago, and one or two others, but
somehow or other literature did not thrive very much in
Peterborough.&nbsp; One gentleman retired from the book club, and
when asked why he gave up he said &ldquo;The fact is I cannot eat
suppers any longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It does not strike me as a good
reason to give up reading, because one would have thought he
could have read better without his supper.&nbsp; However, they
were not then so badly off for newspapers as they were 150 years
ago.</p>
<p>I mentioned just now the &ldquo;Stamford Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have before me a copy of the &ldquo;Stamford Mercury&rdquo; a
friend has kindly lent me, that I might extract a little valuable
comparison.&nbsp; What should we think if our intellectual food
came from sources such as that we got, for instance, in the year
1730, as seen in the &ldquo;Stamford Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
then had a most aspiring title, as you will see:&mdash;&ldquo;The
<span class="smcap">Stamford Mercury</span>, being Historical and
Political Observations on the Transactions of Europe, Together
with Remarks on Trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is this little
sheet&mdash;a good-sized sheet of letter paper, one-eighth taken
up by the title and an illustrated figure of
&ldquo;Mercury.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another eighth is literally taken up
by &ldquo;Bills of Mortality of London for the week or
month,&rdquo; and from it I wonder what some of the diseases of
that day were.&nbsp; One person died of
&ldquo;Headmouldshot,&rdquo; one of &ldquo;Horse Shoehead,&rdquo;
and amongst other things there is very large mortality attributed
to &ldquo;teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another eighth of that paper is
taken up with price lists, giving the rate of exchange between
London and Madrid, also between London and Cadiz, etc.&nbsp; Then
prices of goods at &ldquo;Bear Key.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another eighth
is given up to observations upon the affairs of Europe:
&ldquo;Our Government has received advice from Florence that
Princess Dowager Palatine has renounced all her pretentions to
the succession in favour of Don Carlos,&rdquo; and such pieces as
that, and then the other half is taken up with
advertisements.&nbsp; It is a curious thing that in one <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>advertisement
we are told &ldquo;To Let, the Three Tuns, an old accustomed inn
on the Market Place at Peterborough, Northamptonshire,&rdquo;
that being the site where the present Stamford and Spalding Bank
now stands.&nbsp; That was in 1730.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, in 1755, there is an Ipswich paper, and to
show how history repeats itself, for the consolation of our
farming friends, we are told that amongst other Acts just passed
was one to continue several laws relating to the distemper then
raging among the horned cattle in the Kingdom.&nbsp; There is
nothing new under the sun.&nbsp; We have had it before, and no
doubt they said in that time legislation very much interfered
with the markets.&nbsp; Another curious thing in the paper is
this: &ldquo;The ship the Royal George was put out of the Dock to
go to Spithead.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was this the Royal George that
&ldquo;went down with twice 400 men&rdquo;?&nbsp; Public news was
important just then.&nbsp; There are details as to watching the
French Fleet.&nbsp; Those were very anxious times, but the
peculiarity of those papers is that they gave you so little of
what may be called local news.&nbsp; Our own local papers give
you ample City News and a Complete Chronicle of the affairs of
villages; but you may look through those papers and find nothing
approaching local news excepting this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By a letter from Thirsk in Yorkshire we
learn that very lately a terrible shock of earthquake was felt,
inasmuch that several large rocks were removed to considerable
distances; several large grown elms were swallowed up by the
earth so that no part of them remained to be seen but the
uppermost branches.&nbsp; A man driving a cart near the place,
the horses were so much frightened by the shock that they broke
loose from the carriage and ran away.&nbsp; The horses seem to
have behaved very sensibly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there is an advertisement which strikes one as rather
peculiar, because I think if some of the ladies now-a-days
happened of this misfortune you would hardly put it in the
paper:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lost out of Tom Shave&rsquo;s London
caravan between London and Ipswich (but supposed to be dropped
between here and Colchester) a small black trunk, containing a
pink silk gown, with <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>a pink sarsenet lining, a blue silk
quilted petticoat, a pink silver lined child&rsquo;s hat, a white
chip hat with pink ribbons, a pink silk skirt, two pair of white
cotton stockings, two shifts, two lawn handkerchiefs and
owner&rsquo;s other things, with a hoop petticoat tied on the
outside.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we have lived in the days of the crinoline, but I never
saw one tied on the outside!</p>
<p>To return to the City of Peterborough, we come to the Town
Hall.&nbsp; When I first knew it, it was used as a Sessions
House, but it did not belong to the magistrates, the feoffees
being the owners.&nbsp; It was also used as a County Court until
the present new building was erected.&nbsp; Speaking of the
County Courts, for many years there was no summary jurisdiction
for settling small debts and quarrels, and one really wonders how
the world got on, but one feels certain there must have been a
vast deal of injustice for the want of that which really,
comparatively speaking, now brings justice home to
everybody&rsquo;s own door.&nbsp; Just think in 1810 how
difficult it was to get.</p>
<p>The Magistrates of the Liberty of Peterborough had a general
commission of gaol delivery.&nbsp; There are people living in
Peterborough who recollect a man being hanged on Butcher&rsquo;s
Piece, against the North Bank, under sentence by the local
magistrates, and I should imagine there was as much heard of it
as there is news given in this scrap of print.&nbsp; In 1820 an
Act of Parliament was passed enabling Magistrates at local
jurisdictions to commit persons charged with capital offences for
trial at the Assizes.&nbsp; In the Peterborough Court no counsel
used to appear, and just imagine what a sensation would be
excited if we were now told by our Court of Quarter Sessions that
by authority of their Charter they were going to hang a
man.&nbsp; I recollect when I was a boy at school, just before I
came to Peterborough, I have been into the Old Bailey, and I have
seen put into the dock at the close of the Sessions 15 or 16 men
and women, all of whom were sentenced to be executed.&nbsp; Sheep
stealing, horse stealing, cow stealing, forgery, robbing a
dwelling house to a certain amount <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>were all at that time capital
offences, and you would see in the London newspapers that the
Recorder of the City had been down to Windsor to make his report
to the King, and that there were so many cases of death
sentences, all of which his Majesty was graciously pleased to
respite, except some who were to be executed as a deterrent
example.</p>
<p>There is a novel of Theodore Hook&rsquo;s which gives a most
striking account, partly humorous, and partly tragic, of the
proceedings and sentences at the Old Bailey in those days.&nbsp;
One recollects in the course of his professional experience many
cases of interest.&nbsp; Many striking cases of daring burglaries
have been dealt with in Peterborough.&nbsp; At Glinton a house
was broken into by five or six people, most convincing evidence
was given of their violence and intimidation, and the coolness of
the witnesses on the trial of the prisoners.&nbsp; The witnesses,
as they very frequently are, were ordered out of Court, and as
they were called they pointed out and identified particular
prisoners.&nbsp; After this had been done two or three times, the
gentlemen in the dock changed their positions, thinking that
probably the witnesses had been tutoring one another, and that
they would then defeat them; but it did not answer, and it being
pointed out to the jury, it sealed their conviction, convincing
them that the witnesses were accurate, and not tutored.&nbsp; The
same thing was mentioned in the papers a few days ago as having
occurred when the prisoners were in the dock in Dublin for the
Ph&oelig;nix Park murders.&nbsp; Another case occurred where a
gang who had been the terror of the district, all strangers,
broke into a house, the Thirty Acre Farm, at Fengate, and
striking coolness and courage was shown by a girl who was pulled
out of her bed and threatened with death to compel her to open
her box and produce her money.&nbsp; She afterwards identified
her assailants, some by their voices even.&nbsp; Then there was
the robbery at Orton Stanch.&nbsp; The money taken by the woman
there for tolls was brought to Peterborough weekly, and one night
the place was broken into and the cash box stolen.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>There
was a man called Jack Hall who had settled in this part of the
country, and was connected with others of Yaxley, who committed
several robberies in the district.&nbsp; Hall turned informer; he
was arrested for something else, and gave information, and
Stretton and a man named Humberston were taken separately.&nbsp;
They were first allowed to see, but not speak to, each other, and
were put into separate cells.&nbsp; Mr. Preston, who used to keep
the lock-up at Fletton, locked the door of the passage dividing
the cells, but was careful to leave a policeman in the passage,
where he could hear any conversation between the prisoners.&nbsp;
Towards morning he heard one signal, the other &ldquo;Hist! Jack,
what are you in for?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Stanch,&rdquo; was
the reply.&nbsp; The other said, &ldquo;Jack Hall&rsquo;s split
upon us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind&rdquo; was the answer,
&ldquo;we must deny it altogether.&rdquo;&nbsp; This conversation
was proved at the trial at the assizes, and was relied upon to
confirm the evidence.&nbsp; The prisoners&rsquo; counsel
complained of the way these men had been trapped, but Lord
Justice Campbell, who tried them, pointed out that they were not
asked to say what they did, and they were convicted and sentenced
to transportation for life.</p>
<p>One other case, the robbery at the Vicarage.&nbsp; The thief
was met coming away.&nbsp; He was described as a nice,
gentlemanly looking man.&nbsp; A young policeman met him in the
street, and that thief had the impudence to walk and talk to
him.&nbsp; They walked up to the G.N. Station together, and the
policeman thinking no harm, the burglar got clear away, but he
was apprehended afterwards with others.&nbsp; There was a defence
of an alibi set up for one, and men were brought from Northampton
to declare that he was engaged at a tea garden there at the
time.&nbsp; The jury did not believe them.&nbsp; The same defence
is one of the most common.&nbsp; If proved, it is, of course,
most conclusive, but it is very easy to set up this defence and
get it sworn to.&nbsp; It was once used by a man charged with
stealing a horse, who was found riding away upon its back.&nbsp;
It occurs in Pickwick, when Mr. Weller says: &ldquo;Samivel, why
wasn&rsquo;t there an alibi?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>There
have not been many civil cases of any great interest, but a few
breaches of promise, and one rather peculiar case, known as the
Mud case, tried on the Midland Circuit.&nbsp; It was a question
of right of navigation through what is now Mr. Roberts&rsquo;
granary against the river, and it was stated that barge after
barge had been brought up there.&nbsp; It was shown that it was
physically impossible for a boat to go up there, as there was an
obstruction rendering it impossible for any boat to pass through
it.&nbsp; That trial lasted for years.&nbsp; I was at Northampton
during one of the trials.&nbsp; There was another case between
two tradesmen, one of whom had been thrown amongst some
implements, and in the first trial the verdict was for the
defendant; in the next the plaintiff got one shilling
damages.</p>
<p>I have previously given particulars about the rejoicings we
had when the railways came here.&nbsp; Just let me add one or two
words to show it was not all gain when the railways came.&nbsp;
You used, if you wanted to go to London, to get up early, and, by
the Eastern Counties express, start at 6 o&rsquo;clock, and be
four or five hours going.&nbsp; In going there and coming back
you had done a hard day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; I used to find it
necessary to be called in good time, and recollect asking John
Frisby, who used to run after the mail, to call me.&nbsp; Instead
of doing so a little before six, he called me at three.&nbsp;
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do you know the
time?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought I
had better be in good time.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the railways were
just made, there was very little difference in the time taken to
go to London by the G.N.R. or G.E.R.&nbsp; A good fight took
place between the two companies.&nbsp; You could run by
Northampton for 5s., instead of 11s. or 12s., by the Great
Northern, and I was once beguiled with a lady in going the cheap
route.&nbsp; We started at seven and arrived in London at two in
the afternoon.&nbsp; When we got there we were so tired we could
not go out that day at all.&nbsp; We had return tickets, but gave
them up and came back by the G.N.&nbsp; The Great Northern put a
stop to it by running the direct journey there and back for
5s.&nbsp; I <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>tried that, and, coming home, was pulled in by the
window, the train being overcrowded, and sat not upon the seat,
but the arms between, and experienced for several hours something
like you have seen described after a man has been tarred and
feathered, in riding a rail, or the sensation of the monk who
went into the barber&rsquo;s shop, and instead of paying the
usual twopence, wanted to be shaved for the love of God.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the barber; and he shaved the monk
with cold water, a blunt razor, and a very short allowance of
soap.&nbsp; At the conclusion of which the monk said,
&ldquo;Heaven defend me from ever being shaved again for the love
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He came to the conclusion, as I did, that it
was better to have things at the ordinary price and have them in
the regular way.</p>
<p>Washington Irving tells the story of how one of the early
settlers in the State of New York, not a very industrious person,
walked out on the Catskill Mountains on a shooting expedition,
and met with a party who were playing at skittles.&nbsp; They
invited him to have some whisky and water, which he accepted, and
immediately fell asleep, and at the close of half a century
awoke.&nbsp; His faculties were in precisely the same condition
as when he fell asleep, but the world had progressed around
him.&nbsp; He went home and found those whom he had left young
were grown old, and many of his neighbours had vanished from the
scene.&nbsp; He had gone asleep under the Monarchy and awoke
under the American Republic.&nbsp; That is the story, the
humorous side of which is admirably painted by Washington
Irving.&nbsp; It seems to me that in one point of view, at least
when we exercise that wonderful faculty of memory that power of
abstracting ourselves from what has passed and is passing before
us, and carry ourselves back to the days of our youth, and for a
few moments ignore all that has since passed around us that one
is somewhat in the condition of Washington Irving&rsquo;s hero of
the tale in America!&nbsp; The history of a small city involves
the history and the progress of the nation.&nbsp; The population
of the country has increased relatively as the population of our
own City has increased.&nbsp; The same causes which have led <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>to our
improvement have led to the improvement and the advancement in
wealth, honour, and happiness of the increased population which
these circumstances have brought into being.&nbsp; Nothing, I
think, could be more distressing than to have our progress
blotted out.&nbsp; That is not the way in which a wise and
merciful Providence deals with his creatures.&nbsp; Our troubles,
our afflictions, the memory of those we have lost, become
pleasant memories.&nbsp; We do not fail to notice the beauty of
the thought that those who are taken from us are not lost, but
only gone before.&nbsp; And so it is in the life of a
nation.&nbsp; If one were depicting the life of the nation for
the last 50 year&rsquo;s one would speak of the happiness that
the great bulk of the population enjoyed.</p>
<p>I have lived through the Chartist Riots, the Irish Famine, and
the Cotton Famine, which tried the endurance of our artisans in
the manufacturing districts, and caused in the minds of statesmen
and of every thinking man the great apprehensions as to its
bearing upon the industry and wealth and happiness of the
country.&nbsp; I have lived through periods of war&mdash;the
Crimean War, when the thoughts of everyone were directed to our
Army in distress barely holding its own through that dreadful
winter&mdash;and the Indian Mutiny.&nbsp; All these incidents in
the life of a nation answer to the troubles and afflictions in
the life of the individual.&nbsp; We have survived the troubles
which faced us, and how can I do more than say that thoughts such
as these remind us of our duties as Citizens, as individuals, as
members of the great community, showing us how much we have to be
thankful for and how much we are dependent on circumstances.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
